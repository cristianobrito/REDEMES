                          VERIFICANDO DNS

    Como funciona um dns:
    Basicamente, um servidor DNS serve para responder a uma
    pergunta: Qual o endereço IP do domínio XXX ?
    Em seguida, o servidor DNS retorna com a resposta: O endereço IP é YYY.


    Como descobrir o endereço dns de um dominio
    Todo domínio na internet precisa ter pelo menos 
    dois endereços DNS configurados.
    Então, eles são DNS primário e DNS secundário. 
    Ainda, é possível ter um terceiro,
    A forma para se descobrir o endereço DNS de um domínio, 
    é realizar uma consulta WHOIS. Dessa forma, dentro da consulta WHOIS 
    você encontra os endereços DNS do domínio.
