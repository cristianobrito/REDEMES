                             [ C++ ]
                          instalar libs

1. baixe a lib pretendida. pesquise no google libcurl
   https://curl.se/libcurl/
   https://github.com/curl/curl
   https://curl.se/

2. na pagina de download do curl
   Windows 64 bits	Win64
   Windows 64 bits	7.81.0	binário	o projeto curl
   entre varias versões escolhi essa.
   curl para 64 bits

3. ja no codeblocks crie um projeto c++ do tipo console application

4. considerações na hora de criar um projeto
   Project title
   libCurl

   Folder to create project in:
   C:\Users\brito\Desktop\C++

   Project filename:
   libCurl.cbp

   Resulting filename:
   C:\Users\brito\Desktop\C++\libCurl\libCurl.cbp

5. nesse ponto precisamos extrair a pasta do libcurl dentro da mesma pasta do projeto
   precisaremos da pasta bin, include e lib e elas precisam estar na mesma raiz do nosso 
   projeto onde estão os arquivos libCurl.cbp e main.cpp 
   
   Nossa estrutura fica assim:
   .
  C++
  |
  |——— libCurl
        |
        |——— bin
        |——— include
        |——— lib 
        |——— libCurl.cbp
        |——— main.cpp

   [ 5 diretorios 2 arquivos ]

6. voce pode ver exemplos na pagina de exemplos
   https://curl.se/libcurl/c/example.html
   e pegue um exemplo simples
   https://curl.se/libcurl/c/simplessl.html
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
7. main.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include "include/curl/curl.h"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   CURL *curl;
   CURLcode res;
   
   curl = curl_easy_init();
   if(curl) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);
    
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    if(res != CURLE_OK)
       fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n",
               curl_easy_strerror(res));

      curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
    return 0;
}
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
    FAZENDO AS CONFIGURAÇÕES:

    no codeblocks na area Managment/Projects/libCurl
    click com o direito no nome do projeto libCurl e va em build options
    
    na janela que se abre Project build options click no nome do seu projeto libCurl
    libCurl
     |——— Debug
     |——— Realease

    agora va em Linker settings
    Add procure pela pasta libcurl que colocamos dentro da raiz do projeto e adicione os 
    dois arquivos que estão dentro dela são eles 
    lib\libcurl.a e lib\libcurl.dll.a

8.  COMPLETEI ESSA PARTE COM FOTOS
    consegui acessar a api rick and morty

    https://status.rickandmortyapi.com/
    https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1

    no codigo removi o s do https ficando http devemos prestar atenção nisso
